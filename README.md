## User Research & Goals

### Target Audience  
The primary users are **local parents of K-12 students** in Ithaca. A focused audience ensures the site meets **specific needs** rather than catering to a broad, unfocused user base.

### Key User Insights  
Interviews with three local residents revealed the following priorities:  
1. **Best times to visit** – Avoiding peak crowds and checking vendor availability.  
2. **Dining options** – Planning meals due to limited food vendors.  
3. **Vendor previews** – Seeing which merchants from past years are returning.

## Content Strategy

### Planned Content  
- **Essential event details** – Dates, hours, location, schedule  
- **Vendor & performer lineup** – Listings with categories  
- **Planning resources** – Map, parking, accessibility, directions  
- **FAQs** – Answers to common visitor concerns  

### Content Justification  
Users expressed **limited availability** and wanted to **maximize their visit**. The content was structured to **help them plan efficiently** without excessive searching.

## Site Structure & Navigation

### Iterative Content Organization  
I tested different page structures to ensure **logical flow** and **ease of use**.

#### **Iteration 1: Four Pages**
![cardsort photo](design/sort_1.jpg)  
- Separate pages for performers and vendors.  
- Dedicated **FAQ page** for planning and guidelines.  

#### **Iteration 2: Three Pages**
![cardsort photo](design/sort_2.jpg)  
- **Vendors on their own page** due to user demand.  
- Event schedules moved to **homepage** for quick access.  

#### **Iteration 3: Final Version**
![Cardsort 3](design/sort_3.jpg)  
- FAQs integrated within relevant pages for **better accessibility**.  
- Vendors included in **planning section** to help users strategize their visit.  

### **Final Page Structure**
1. **Home** – Key event details, announcements, COVID guidelines  
2. **Performers & Vendors** – Event schedule, artist lineup, vendor list  
3. **Plan Your Visit** – Map, directions, parking, public transit  
4. **FAQ** – Answers to common questions  

This structure **minimized page count** while keeping content **clear and goal-oriented**.

## Visual Design Approach

### Design Elements  
- **Minimalist layout** – Focused on **usability** over flashy aesthetics.  
- **Sans-serif typography** – Clean and legible for all age groups.  
- **Red/brown accents** – Ties in with the autumn theme.  
- **Consistent navigation** – Uniform menus across all pages.  

### **Final Desktop & Mobile Layouts**
#### **Mobile Design:**
![mobile layout](design/mb_layout.jpg)  
- Single-column layout for **better readability**.  
- Stacked navigation for **easy access**.  

#### **Desktop Design:**
![desktop layout](design/dtop_layout.jpg)  
- Sidebar navigation for quick **page switching**.  
- Categorized vendor listings for **efficient browsing**.  

## User Testing & Refinements

### Testing Scenarios  
1. **Find a specific vendor** (e.g., B&B Kettle Corn).  
2. **Check if vendors accept credit cards**.  

### Key Findings & Design Fixes
